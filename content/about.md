<p style="text-align: justify;">Cannabis analyst sounds a bit pretentious, doesn’t it? Some would say there’s nothing to analyse. Just smoke it, no questions asked. If you belong to the group of ignorant cannabis enjoyers then this is not a website for you.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So, who is cannabis analyst? The name is Haris Velic. I am a data analyst specialized in Business Information Systems and Business Intelligence.
Now you know why I’m analyst. But why cannabis? I’m simply a cannabis enthusiast, madly in love with the plant which makes this world happier, healthier and wealthier place. Since I am not a typical data analyst, I decided to combine my profession and my love to turn information into action. I will use knowledge collected throughout my education to methodically examine and accurately interpret all aspects of cannabis business. Join me on my mission as we discover the full potential of the industry which will rule the world.</p>
