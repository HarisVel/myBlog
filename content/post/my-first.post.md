### H3 You think you are so special?   

<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, indeed you are. Your heart will beat 100,000 times today. It is going to pump the blood which travels for more than 60,000 miles in 24-hour period. You are made out of 50 trillion cells and every cell has 1.4 volts, so there is 70 hundred trillion volts electricity in your body right now. By the time you read this sentence 25 trillion new cells will be created by your body...</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">While your body parts work so hard to produce the energy that maintains all the functions, mankind uses that energy to destroy the nature. 80,000 acres of rainforests were destroyed in last 24 hours and 13 million tons of toxic chemicals are released in the environment. More than 130 plant and animal species were brought to extinction. We are simply taught that destruction is normal. Nowadays, mankind possesses knowledge like never before. We made enormous technological advancement, but somehow our society is retrograde. Just yesterday, more than 45,000 people died from hunger, 38,000 of them were children. Men destroy not only environment but their fellow man too.    </p>


<p style="text-align: justify;"> However, you could change these devastating figures even though it seems like an impossible mission. You can change everything for better because we are programmed to improve. For example, humans shed about 600,000 particles of skin every hour. Your body ditches the bad things so that new, more useful ones could take their place and make your life better. So do not tell me the change is impossible. The change is within you. Just listen to your body and follow the laws of nature.  </p>


<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="/img/ca_g.png#floatleft" width="510"/> There is hope... Hope that we can undo centuries of destruction. Let us return just 100 years ago when the world was powered by carbohydrates. All fibers, fuels and medicines were product of photosynthesis. If you think outside the box for just a moment you will notice the power of one beautiful plant. That plant is cannabis and it certainly gives us faith in a better future. Cannabis can be used for nutrition, medicine and health-care, construction, textile and fibers. It vitalizes the soil and it is an excellent source of biomass. If you have cannabis seed, you won’t starve to death. It has omega-3, omega-6 and all amino acids, simply everything necessary for life. Cannabis can grow in harsh climate as well, thus solving the problem of world hunger.

<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a plastic island in our oceans that is twice the size of the biggest continental state in USA - Texas. Cannabis solves this problem as well. It decontaminates the soil and doesn’t pollute the Earth since it is biodegradable. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We could produce paper and cellulose from hemp, instead of destroying the forests unnecessarily.
2.1 billion people live without easy access to safe water. Regardless of the fact that cotton requires 20 times more water than cannabis hemp, it still dominates the textile industry. Moreover, hemp fabric is softer, warmer and more durable than cotton and soon it will become a champion of textile and fiber industry as well. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Let us not forget the problem of bees apocalypse. It is said that bees are a sign of well-functioning ecosystem but the collapse of bee colonies all over the world suggests we live in disorganized one. Bees and other pollinators are responsible for pollinating nearly three quarters of the plants that produce 90% of the world’s food. With their extinction life on earth will soon come to an end. But there is cannabis to save us all. Since cannabis has two sexes, male and female, it can pollinate itself. Thus, cannabis hemp cultivation could once again prevent world hunger.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">Two main components of cannabis, CBD and THC, do miracles for your health. Whether for improvement of physical or mental health, cannabis can do it all. And we must never forget that cannabis is source of happiness. Just one puff and you are in the land of joy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is truly a omnipotent plant and I have just mentioned a few things it can do. As I became more familiar with the unlimited powers of the plant I have fallen in love with, I decided to embark on a mission to explore the cannabis world and share my findings with you. Since we live in the era of big data I will use my professional experience to display the full potential of cannabis industry. Colorful facts and in depth statistics which I am about to show you are useful for first-time smokers as well as for investors. It does not matter if you are in cannabis world for pure enjoyment or making huge profits. If you want fresh and reliable information, this is a place for you.</p>
