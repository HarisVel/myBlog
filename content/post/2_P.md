<p style="text-align: justify;">Thousands of cannabis-related businesses are seeking to raise fund . This is an excellent opportunity for far-sighted investors to add new highly profitable companies to their portfolio. Even tough most investors in cannabis industry are still individual retailers, we can expect high roller venture capitalist to join the industry as more favourable legal regulations are being implemented. Prior to entering cannabis industry, investors must perform proper due diligence and clearly understand cultural, economic and legal system which is specific to each market. As cannabis companies slowly enter stock exchange market we can expect increased participation from institutional and strategic investors.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="/img/cann_alc.png#floatleft" width="510"/> Building upon analyses of U.S. cannabis and alcohol sales in 2018, consuming habits of an average American and popularity of aromatherapy it is safe to say that cannabis terpene beverages are going to be a new hit in both alcohol and cannabis industry. Constellation Brands, Inc., a Fortune 500 company and an international producer and marketer of beer, wine and spirits, has already invested around $190 million in cannabis industry.</p> 

[<p style="text-align: justify;"> Just like with different cannabis strains, different terpenes produce different effects and aromas. Some terpenes have soothing effects like linalool, whilst pinene and limonene have energizing effect. Researches have proven anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of terpenes. </p>](https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/terpenes-the-flavors-of-cannabis-aromatherapy)
